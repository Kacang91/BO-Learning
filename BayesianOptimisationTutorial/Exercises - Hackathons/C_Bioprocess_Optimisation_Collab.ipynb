        "\n",
        "#### Hackathon Breif\n",
        "This hackathon involves the optimisation of a simulated bioprocess at process scale utilising CHO cells to produce a desired protein. Experimentally, this would involve a resource-intensive screening campaign involving the growth and feeding of cells under precise conditions (temperature, pH, feed amount, fidelity, etc.) to maximize the production of a desired product. This hackathon offers a simulated method of mapping bioprocess input parameters to a final predicted titre concentration: a measure of cell productivity. The simulations are based on various kinetic parameters which are unique to the type of cells used. For the final scoring, a different set of cell kinetic parameters will be used to evaluate your algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Inputs and Outputs\n",
        "Inputs to the bioprocess includes 5 vairables: the temperature [°C], pH and the concentration of feed [mM] at 3 different timepoints over 150 minutes. The output is the concentration of the titre (desired product) [g/L]. The goal is to obtain the input variables that correspond to the highest obtained titre.\n",
        "\n",
        "The bounds of the inputs are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "temperature [°C]               -> 30 - 40\n",
        "pH                             -> 6 - 8\n",

        "#### Fidelities and Running the simulation\n",
        "The simulations can be perfomed at 3 levels of fidelities with an associated accuracy and costs. These fidelities corresponds to a different reactor type and scale used.\n",

The inputs to this function is a matrix of shape (N, 6) where N is the number of data points and 6 refers to the total number of variables in the following order: `[temperature, pH, feed1, feed2, feed3, fidelity]`. The fidelities are refered to as integers where `0` corresponds to the lowest fidelity, `1` with the middle and `2` with the highest fidelity. An example is shown below.\n",

You have a **budget of 15000** (observe the cost of running each fidelity) and starting with a maximum of 7 training points that is not a part of the budget. (Remember, you have to have at least 2 points for each variable for the covariance matrix to be calculated.)\n",

        "#### Guidance (Intermediate - Multi-batch Bayesian Optimsation)\n",
        "You can construct a single-sequential or batch BO algorithm to perform the optimisation. The lowest fidelity experiments do not offer accurate outcomes and you have to choose how many number of expeirments for each fidelity to be performed such that you do not exceed your allocated budget. To link between each fideility, one could perform optimisation on the lower fidilities and then translate the best input conditions to run the highest fidelity experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Guidance (Advanced - Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimisation)\n",
        "You can develop a multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimisation algorithm to perform the optimisation. Since the score is based on the highest titre concentration of the highest fidelity, it might be beneficial if you constrain (at least) the last experiment to be run with the highest fidelity - this mitigates the risk that your algorithm does not perform any experiments with the highest fidelity. A basic MFBO algorithm could be created by modifying the acquisition function to one that is cost aware. For example: we have previously used Lower Confidence Bound to balance exploration and exploitation of the search space (see notebook section C). To make this cost aware, we can scale the values obtained from LCB by the cost.\n",
